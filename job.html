        <h1 class="headings">Ideal Job</h1>
        <p>Though it'll take some time to have both the IT knowledge and language skills required, my ideal IT job is one that involves software and/or applications that help teach</p>
        <p>languages. Though most of these jobs are based in countries outside of Australia, I believe that the rise of working remotely, and freelancing opportunities will soon help</p>
        <p>secure at least a consideration for me to work with these companies.</p>
        <p><br>Working with a company such as <a href="https://ai.glossika.com/careers">Glossika</a> would be ideal, but I have no preference for what role. Thus, I'll be going over</p>
        <p>the three the most caught my eye. All jobs mentioned are listed in the hyperlink.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><br></p>
       
        <h2 class="headings2">Frontend Developer</h2>
        <p>The position is described in the title, being one with a focus on the frontend experience of users of the Glossika website. Building code and libraries that can are both</p>
        <p>high quality and reusable for various webpages, ensuring and optimising quick response times of the webpages, along with troubleshooting issues between the frontend and</p>
        <p>backend and fixing them are some of the included responsibilities.</p>
        <p><br>As a user of Glossika, I believe the position would be a good fit simply on the basis that I'm more motivated to work on and help improve a service I already use. This</p> 
        <p>goes without saying for the res of the positions too, of course.</p>
        <p><br>The position requirements include being fluent in English and/or Chinese, a familiarity with JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5, React, RWD (Responsive Web Design), Git, and</p> <p>experience with Redux. Preference is also given to those with experience with the last requirement, along with experience with SPA (Single Page Application) and unit</p>
        <p>testing framework.</p>
        <p><br>My current qualifications start and end at being a fluent English speaker, but I have some basic knowledge in some of the listed requirements. Though not nearly enough</p> 
        <p>to call myself familiar, I have some experience with HTML and CSS and will be gaining more as I continue my Introduction to Information Technology course. Git is also</p> <p>something I'll be becoming more familiar with in my studies. Though not required as I'm a fluent English speaker, I also have basic knowledge of Chinese.</p>
        <p><br>Just by completing the Intro to IT course will give me experience in HTML, CSS, and Git along with a general idea on how to pursue the other requirements. My Intro to</p>
        <p>Programming course will also further support my education in these areas, though some more indirectly. Continuing into a full Bachelor of Information Technology will help</p> 
        <p>with both leaning the ins and outs of the subject, but also provide me with chances to gain employment opportunities to further my skills.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        
        <h2 class="headings2">Backend Developer</h2>
        <p>The other side to frontend development's coin, backend development focuses on the guts of Glossika. Databases, API, and algorithm design are the name of the game.</p>
        <p><br>Requirements this time around are far steeper, fluency in English and/or Chinese, PHP, modern PHP frameworks such as Laravel, Unix-like commands, MySQL, nginx, Git, and AWS services along with</p> <p>preference with those with skills in Redis, testing, and basic knowledge in jQuery and webs security is no small list.
        </p>
        <p><br>Again, I'm left with my fluency in English qualification as my only boon. I'm unsure of how many of the requirements I'll gain familiarity with in both my Intro to IT and Intro to Programming courses,</p> 
        <p>but I know I'll at least gain more familiarity with Git as I continue to work with my fellow students. Though I assume I'll at least dip my toes into the majority if not all the listed requirements.</p>
        <p><br>If I'm truly serious about becoming a Backend Developer for Glossika, I'll need to complete the full Bachelor of Information Technology to confidently say I have the education to back up my future skills.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        
        <h2 class="headings2">Computational Linguist</h2>
        <p>This is the big one that I'm interested in, and the one that'll require the most specialised training and experience to obtain a shot at. Analysis and development of tools to both automate the process for</p> 
        <p>the linguistics team and to improve the learning algorithms are major focus points.</p>
        <p><br>The requirements are deceptively short, requiring a proficiency in Laravel, JavaScript or Python, an understanding of both Unicode and IPA, and a background in sound analysis tools. None of which I</p> 
        <p>currently have, though I will be studying Python in my Intro to Programming course.</p>
        <p><br>For this job to become obtainable, I'll need to complete both a Bachelor of Information Technology and a Linguistics degree. An achievable goal, though it'll take several more years of study than what</p>
        <p>I'm currently expecting to do.</p>
        <p><br> <br></p>
