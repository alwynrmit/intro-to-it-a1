    <section id="project">
        <h1 class="headings">Project Idea</h1>
        <p>I've decided that my project will include one of my biggest passions, languages. A simple RPG in the vein of Shin Megami Tensei crossed with a translation-based language learning program.<br></p>
        <p><br></p>
        
        <h2 class="headings2">Overview</h2>
        <p>The enemy monster will say a sentence in either English or the target language, and the player much respond with the correct equivalent in the opposite language. The reward for getting the correct answer</p> 
        <p>is either money, an item, or the enemy joining your party. If you get the answer wrong, the enemy will attack.</p>
        <p><br>Attack names, enemy stats, and names will be in the target language.</p>
        <p><br>The sentences will use simple language and be taken from sites and programs like Tatoeba, Duolingo, Omniglot, and Glossika. It will be an immersion-based experience, with the player learning</p> <p>vocabulary as they go.</p>
        <p><br></p>
       
        <h2 class="headings2">Motivation</h2>
        <p>While gamified language learning applications are nothing new, they tend to be either be too stale in content to be actively engaging or simplified to a degree that has the learning aspect fail to stick</p> 
        <p>long term.</p>
        <p><br>By making the gameplay involve pattern recognition and vocabulary acquisition through immersion, the player will be far more likely to remember certain words and grammar.</p>
        <p><br>Language learners that study via games are more likely to want to learn for the sake of consuming media over communication. Thus, having a game specifically geared towards learning the language and</p> 
        <p>using common RPG words will both help motivate study and allow them to better understand other games not geared towards language.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        
        <h2 class="headings">Description</h2>
        <p>For the first alpha build on the project, there won't be any story elements or world building. Instead, the project will focus on building a simple progression from basic words to easy sentences via</p> <p>different enemies and the levelling system introducing new skills and harder enemies.</p>
        <p><br>Experience points will be given based on accuracy of the answer given to the enemy along with using the right skills on enemies based on their descriptions. Elemental advantage will factor in, along</p>  
        <p>with effectiveness based on monster clan/race.</p>
        <p><br>As this will be an immersion-based environment, the content will be challenging at first. Therefore, the first few levels and areas will factor this in a have a bit of a grace period. Saving is also</p> 
        <p>allowed at anytime in case of partywide wipes.</p>
        <p><br>The challenge will come from the learning elements, thus the systems in place to support those elements will be kept as least frustrating as possible. No artificial difficulty or RNG based elements</p> 
        <p>will be used to provide more of a challenge.</p>
        <p><br>For the main bulk of the game, the translation will be the focus. Every time the player enters a fight, the monster will have dialogue in either English or the target language. The first time the</p> <p>dialogue appears will always be in the target language.</p>
        <p><br>The player is then prompted to select the matching sentence in the other language. In lower levels, it will be a simple translation. After the dialogue has appeared enough times, the answer will</p> <p>change to a response to that dialogue.</p>
        <p><br>For example, if the original sentence is 'where is Tom?'' the new answer might be 'Tom is at home', while the wrong sentences might be 'Tom is a boy' or 'Tom is 20 years old'.</p>
        <p><br>Since this is a proof-of-concept alpha build with no story or world building elements, there will be minimal to no dialogue outside of combat and most encounters will be randomly generated.</p>
        <p><br>The game will keep a counter on which dialogue and vocabulary has been used, both to avoid repetition outside of reinforcement and to gauge what new dialogue should be added to the pool.</p>
        <p><br>If possible, certain monsters may have dialogue based on their appearance, element, or race/clan in order to better associate the terms with images.</p>
        <p><br>For example, monsters based on animals will have sentences associated with animals, while humanoid monster may have more causal, day to day dialogue.</p>
        <p><br>This will not be an all-in-one product to be used alone to learn a language, but rather another tool to add to a user's study arsenal.</p>
        <p><br>The languages available will depend on what free resources are currently available. Teaching a foreign script will not be included in the first alpha. Text to speech or pre-recorded audio is a</p> <p>potential feature but will depend on both what's available in the toolkit of the game engine used and what resources are used to mine sentences in the first place.</p>
        <p><br>Difficulty options will not be available in the alpha, at it will be assumed that the player has little to no experience in the language.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        
        <h2 class="headings2">Tools and Technologies</h2>
        <p>Depending on if this project materialises as a 2D or 3D game, there are several free and paid software and assets that may be used. For 3D, the Unity Engine or Unreal Engine are available to use for free</p> 
        <p>with no royalties for $100,000 USD annually and the first $1,000,000 USD earned respectively. Unity can also be used for 2D software.</p>
        <p><br>For 2D, GameMaker Studio 2 has several subscription models available while the multiple versions of RPG Maker only cost an upfront fee for the software with free assets available in all versions and</p>
        <p>even a basic character sprite editor is later iterations.</p>
        <p><br>Vocabulary will be gathered based on the websites and software listed in the overview.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        
        <h2 class="headings2">Skills Required</h2>
        <p>At least one coding language will be needed, the specifics changing from program to program. Unity will require knowledge in C#, Unreal will need C++. GameMaker Studio 2 has its own language, GameMaker</p> 
        <p>Language or GML. Depending on the version of RPG Maker, the language required will either be a simplistic built-in language, Ruby, or JavaScript.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        
        <h2 class="headings2">Outcome</h2>
        <p>Should this project be successful, the common issue of balancing fun and education within language learning tools will both be solved in this specific instance and will set a standard and baseline for</p>
        <p>others to follow to better create tools and resources for studying a language.</p>
        <p><br>Again, this will not be a stand-alone resource, but there is no one program that can magically teach you a language fluently. Only multiple tools that can work together.</p>
