        <h1 class="headings">Interest in IT</h1>
        <p>My first introduction to IT was through my family's long running interest in computers, my own interests remaining passive as I grew up. The catalyst from passive to</p> <p>active interest was through speculative fiction of the 90s on how technology would have advanced to today, particularly Serial Experiments Lain.</p>
        <p><br>Throughout my late teens and early twenties my interest turned into a full-on spark, from working on a game development jam with a close friend to listening to my</p> <p>electronic music production teacher discussing how synthesisers and the work of Wendy Carlos has affected the creation of music to this day.</p>
        <p><br>I chose to begin my studies with RMIT through OUA for several reasons, one being that I'm unsure of what career path I'd like to commit to. Not finishing high school was</p>
        <p>also a factor, and if I do decide to pursue IT wholly then I'll be able to begin a diploma in the coming year without having to worry about my lack of ATAR. I also had a</p>
        <p>previously good experience with RMIT as an adult VCE student in 2019-2020 before withdrawing due to COVID-19 leaving the future uncertain.</p>
        <p><br>Throughout both this course and my Intro to Programming studies, I believe I'll both learn a solid base that I can use to further my IT studies if I chose and will</p> <p>have enough experience to dip my toes into the job market either as a freelancer or entry level employee.</p>

        <h1 class="headings">Personal Profile</h1>
        
        <h2 class="headings2">INFP</h2>
        <p>Also known as 'the Healer', 'the Mediator', or 'the Empath'. Introverted, intuitive, feeling, and perceptive.
        </p>
        <p><br>While the introverted aspect of my personality type can be seen as a bane in a collaborative environment, the internal nature of my full being is one of creativity and</p>
        <p>empathy. The relationships and comradery I form are deep and built not only on a need to get along for a greater goal, but one of empathy and compassion.</p>
        <p><br>It makes me an emotional person, but not irrational and certainly not one without an inner logic unsuitable for the IT industry. If anything, being more in touch with</p>
        <p>both my own and other people's feelings can be a boon for an industry with an often-unnecessary focus on logical thinking. People may say tech is rational and unthinking,</p> 
        <p>but people are what create technology in the first place.</p>
        <p><br>As an INFP, I believe I could be an excellent mediator and sensitivity guide when it comes to human reaction both within the team and with those who will interact with</p>
        <p>the final product.</p>
        <p><br></p>
       
        <h2 class="headings2">Tactile-Visual Learner</h2>
        <p>Learning from information both being communicated visually and through action takes a bit of time, but the result is having a far deeper understanding of both what I've</p> 
        <p>learnt and how to best apply it in practice.</p>
        <p><br>Working with a team may be difficult with people who are impatient, they may grow frustrated if I struggle with a concept that they're able to grasp without the extra</p>
        <p>effort. However, I believe that with a team who is better in sync with my needs or is willing to help me learn as I go will find both a dutiful student and a teammate that</p>
        <p>will become an asset in future projects.</p>
        <p><br>It would be best to form a team with people who have more experience than I, along with them having a partial mentor mentality along with patience.</p>
        <p><br></p>
       
        <h2 class="headings2">Big Five Conscientious</h2>
        <p>Reliability and long-term success are traits associated with conscientious people, though some may focus their lack of short-term success and cautiousness. I would argue</p>
        <p>that having dutifulness and cautiousness in the long-term is ultimately better than having short-term success, especially in an industry where short-term success is often</p>
        <p>followed by long term failure.</p>
        <p><br>I think this'll influence goal setting and discussion of ideas by fellow teammates. Something that may seem like a great and fresh idea may not be feasible in the</p> long-term.</p>
        <p><br>Teams that have deadlines and goals further into the future may prove to be the best environment for me, with fellow collaborators looking into the longevity of a <p>project over what'll be cool and exciting for a month or so.</p>
